Test_AI-threat-detection
Overview
Test_AI-threat-detection is a proof-of-concept project developed to explore AI-driven threat detection in network security. This project implements a basic machine learning model to identify potential network intrusions, focusing on Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, using a simplified dataset and Python-based tools. It serves as a learning exercise to demonstrate data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for cybersecurity applications.
Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares network traffic data for analysis.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest classifier to detect anomalies indicative of DoS attacks.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Modular Codebase: Organized scripts for data handling, model training, and prediction.

Requirements

Python 3.8+
Libraries:
pandas
scikit-learn
numpy


Dataset: NSL-KDD (or similar network traffic dataset, not included in the repository)

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Nucl3arAt0m/Test_AI-threat-detection.git
cd Test_AI-threat-detection


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Place the dataset (e.g., KDDTrain+.txt) in the data/ directory and update file paths in the scripts as needed.


Usage

Preprocess Data: Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset:
python preprocess_data.py


Train Model: Train the Random Forest model:
python train_model.py


Evaluate Model: Check model performance:
python evaluate_model.py

Outputs include a classification report with key metrics.

Dataset
This project was tested with the NSL-KDD dataset, filtered for DoS and normal traffic. You can download it from NSL-KDD or use a similar network traffic dataset. Ensure the dataset is in CSV format or modify preprocess_data.py to handle other formats.
Results
The model achieves reasonable performance on the test dataset, with metrics such as:

Accuracy: ~95% (varies by dataset and preprocessing)
Precision/Recall: Balanced for DoS detection Detailed results are printed when running evaluate_model.py.

Future Improvements

Add real-time traffic analysis capabilities.
Incorporate additional attack types (e.g., probing, R2L).
Implement a web interface for easier interaction.
Optimize model hyperparameters using grid search.
